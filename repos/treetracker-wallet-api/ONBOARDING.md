# Onboarding Guide — treetracker-wallet-api

_Generated from the Understand-Anything knowledge graph. Source commit `e95c15a`._

## Project Overview

**treetracker-wallet-api** is a Greenstand Node.js/Express REST API backed by PostgreSQL (via
Knex). It manages **wallets** that accumulate tree-planting tokens, **trust relationships** that
gate which wallets may move tokens between each other, and the **transfer lifecycle** (pending,
requested, completed, declined, cancelled) for both explicit tokens and unclaimed bundles. Every
protected endpoint sits behind JWT (RS256) and API-key authentication, with per-wallet audit
event logging.

- **Languages:** JavaScript, SQL, PL/pgSQL, JSON, YAML, Dockerfile, shell, Markdown
- **Frameworks:** Express, Knex, Mocha, Docker, Docker Compose, GitHub Actions
- **Entry points:** `server/server.js` (process boot) and `server/app.js` (Express app assembly)

The code follows a layered flow: **router → handler → service → model → repository → database**,
with JWT/API-key authentication and event/audit logging as cross-cutting concerns.

## Architecture Layers

| Layer | Files | What it holds |
|---|---|---|
| **API Layer** | 31 | Express app bootstrap, route handlers, routers, Joi-style request schemas, and the OpenAPI/Postman API contracts for auth, event, token, transfer, trust, and wallet resources. |
| **Service Layer** | 10 | Business logic services orchestrating authentication, hashing, JWT issuance, S3 uploads, and token/transfer/trust/wallet operations between handlers and repositories. |
| **Data Layer** | 94 | Domain models, Knex-based repositories, the database session/connection client, and db-migrate migrations plus raw SQL defining the PostgreSQL wallet schema. |
| **Utility Layer** | 5 | Shared cross-cutting helpers, enums (transfer/trust states), and the `HttpError` class used across handlers, services, and repositories. |
| **Infrastructure** | 19 | Docker and docker-compose container definitions, Kubernetes/Kustomize deployment manifests, and the AWS S3 client used to run and deploy the wallet API. |
| **CI/CD Pipelines** | 20 | GitHub Actions workflows and their build/test/deploy steps, plus the pull request template. |
| **Configuration** | 12 | Environment files, linting/formatting rules, commit conventions, package manifests, and code ownership settings. |
| **Documentation** | 2 | Top-level README and CHANGELOG describing the wallet API and its release history. |
| **Operational Scripts** | 15 | One-off Node.js and shell scripts for creating wallets, seeding demo data, and batch-generating tokens outside the running API. |
| **Test Suite** | 72 | Legacy, integration, and end-to-end test specs plus mock data and colocated unit tests. |

## Key Concepts

- **Session-scoped transactions.** Every service call runs over a `Session`
  (`server/infra/database/Session.js`) wrapping a Knex connection, letting callers begin, commit,
  or roll back a transaction shared across multiple repository calls — the mechanism `TransferService`
  relies on for atomic transfers.
- **Repository inheritance.** Every repository extends `BaseRepository` (`server/repositories/BaseRepository.js`),
  which supplies shared CRUD, a recursive where-clause builder, pagination, and batch-insert logic.
  `WalletRepository` builds on this with a union query across self, child, and managed wallets.
- **Trust gates transfer.** `Wallet.hasControlOver()` (hierarchical parent/sub-wallet control) and
  `Trust`'s request/accept/decline/cancel lifecycle together authorize whether tokens may move
  between two wallets — this coupling threads through Trust, Transfer, Token Query, and Audit
  Logging.
- **Transfer state machine.** `Transfer.js` and `Token.js` orchestrate trust checks, wallet-control
  checks, and state transitions (pending, requested, completed, cancelled) for both explicit token
  and unclaimed bundle transfers, defined by `transfer-enum.js` and `trust-enums.js`.
- **Dual authentication.** `ApiKeyService` validates the `treetracker-api-key` header (existence,
  deprecation, endpoint-specific permissions like batch-create); `JWTService` signs/verifies RS256
  tokens carrying `wallet_id`, used to resolve "the logged-in wallet" for authorization everywhere.
- **Audit trail.** Every domain (auth, wallet, trust, transfer, token) emits events through the
  Event/Audit Logging domain for a queryable per-wallet history.

## Guided Tour

Follow these steps in order to learn the codebase end to end:

1. **Project Overview** — Read the `README` for setup (database, environment variables, JWT
   keygen) and the layered service/model/repository architecture.
2. **Bootstrap and App Configuration** — `server/server.js` boots the process; `server/app.js`
   wires CORS, body parsing, all routes, and the global error handler.
3. **Routing Layer** — `server/routes/index.js` aggregates sub-routers (auth, token, transfer,
   trust, wallet, event); each router maps a URL prefix to handler functions.
4. **Handlers and Request Validation** — Handlers validate input via `schemas.js`, then delegate
   to the matching service (`authHandler` → `AuthService`, `transferHandler` → `TransferService`,
   etc.), keeping the service layer free of Express-specific code.
5. **Authentication: JWT and API Keys** — `AuthService` verifies a hashed password and calls
   `JWTService` to sign an RS256 token; `ApiKeyService` validates the API-key header on protected
   endpoints.
6. **Service Layer: Business Logic** — `WalletService` (CRUD, control-over checks),
   `TrustService` (trust lifecycle), and `TransferService` (the largest: initiate, accept,
   decline, cancel, fulfill, each wrapped in a transaction with an audit event).
7. **Domain Models: Wallet, Trust, Transfer** — `Wallet.js` implements hierarchical control
   checks; `Trust.js` manages the trust lifecycle; `Transfer.js` orchestrates trust/control
   checks and state transitions per `trust-enums.js` / `transfer-enum.js`.
8. **Repositories and Database Session** — `BaseRepository` provides shared CRUD and query
   building; `WalletRepository` unions self/child/managed wallets; `Session.js` wraps the Knex
   connection/transaction that `TransferService` depends on for atomicity.
9. **Database Schema and Migrations** — db-migrate migrations create the `wallet`, `entity_trust`,
   and `transfer` tables; `database/README.md` explains the migration command reference.
10. **Testing Strategy: Unit, Integration, E2E** — Unit tests (`TransferService.spec.js`) mock
    dependencies; integration tests (`bundle-transfer-decline.spec.js`) hit a seeded real database;
    E2E tests (`__tests__/e2e/`) run Mocha root hooks against a live deployed environment.
11. **Containerization** — The `Dockerfile` (node:16-alpine, single-stage) packages the app;
    `docker-compose.yml` spins up local Postgres 13 for development.
12. **Kubernetes Deployment** — Kustomize base manifests (`deployment.yaml`, `kustomization.yaml`)
    define production rollout (2 replicas, JWT/DB/S3 secrets), with dev/test/prod overlays.
13. **CI/CD Pipelines** — The pull-request workflow lints, migrates, and tests on every PR; the
    build-deploy-dev workflow builds/pushes a Docker image, deploys to Kubernetes, then runs E2E
    tests against the freshly deployed environment.

## Complexity Hotspots

Approach these areas carefully — they carry the most logic or the largest surface (97 files rated
moderate+, 33 rated complex):

- **`server/services/TransferService.js`** (complex) — orchestrates the full transfer lifecycle
  (initiate, accept, decline, cancel, fulfill) across wallets, tokens, and bundles, each step
  wrapped in a transaction with event logging.
- **`server/services/WalletService.js`** (complex) — central wallet CRUD, sub-wallet lookups,
  control-over authorization, and CSV-based batch wallet creation/transfer.
- **`server/models/Transfer.js`** and **`server/models/Token.js`** (complex) — the transfer/token
  state machine encoding trust checks, wallet-control checks, and state transitions.
- **`server/handlers/transferHandler/index.js`**, **`trustHandler/index.js`**,
  **`walletHandler/index.js`** (complex) — the widest handler surface, each covering many
  lifecycle endpoints.
- **`server/repositories/TransferRepository.js`**, **`TrustRepository.js`** (complex) — CTE-based
  insert/update queries joined with wallet names, plus specialized filtered/paginated lookups.
- **`docs/api/spec/treetracker-wallet-api.yaml`** and **`treetracker-wallet-api-v1-10.yaml`**
  (complex) — the OpenAPI contracts; large but authoritative.
- **`docs/api/postman/treetracker-wallet-api-collection.json`** (complex) — large Postman
  collection documenting the full HTTP surface.
- **`server/services/TransferService.spec.js`**, **`server/repositories/BaseRepository.spec.js`**,
  and the handler `*.spec.js` files (complex) — large test suites; read them to see real
  end-to-end behavior for each lifecycle.
